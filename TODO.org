#+TODO: TODO(t) STARTED(s@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)

* TODO find out how to write one initializer functions instead of two
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC zig
  // ...
  pub fn array_init() Self {}  
  pub fn object_init() Self {}
  // ...
  #+END_SRC

* DONE Use zig-args
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-05-24 Sun 23:50]
  #+BEGIN_SRC zig
  args = @import("args");

* DONE Adjust build to include zig-args
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-05-24 Sun 22:33]
  The gurl project contains an example adding an external depency
  manually and with zpm. Use the manual way first. zig-args is the
  only dependency right now!

* DONE Use arguments parser for argument parsing 
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-05-24 Sun 22:29]
  The are multiple argument parser to choose from. Choose wisely.

    Was updated some days ago. Is used a simple project called gurl.

* TODO pr for json api changes
  Found a simple regression in the +fn std.json.dump+ function. I do
  not use this function anymore, but the version zig relead 0.6.0 does
  not work until code is changed.
* TODO access to struct within struct witout pointers
  The first version of my document structure contained a 
  field to an std.json.ValueTree object. Using this structure was not possible.
  
  Create a small sample zig file with e.g. the following code.

  #+BEGIN_SRC zig
    const Document = union(enum) {

	array: ValueTree,
	object: ValueTree,

	const Self = @This();

	/// this may lead to an type error.
	/// needs checking
	fn appendToArray(self: *Self, string: []const u8) !void {
	    var value = std.json.Value{ .String = string };
	    _ = try self.array.root.Array.append(value);
	}
    }
  #+END_SRC
* TODO Parsing json from parameters
  When creating complex json documents one needs to cascade zjo calls. 
  The following example

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  zjo abc=$(zjo -a a b c) '"123"'=$(zjo -a 1 2 3)
  #+END_SRC

  should produce the following object:

  #+BEGIN_SRC json
    { 
	"abc" = [
	    "a",
	    "b",
	    "c"
	], 
    	"123" = [
	    1,
	    2,
	    3
	]
    }
  #+END_SRC
  
* TODO Write more tests for document struct
  - initializiation
  - printing (could be hard with current api)
  - append elements
* DONE implement strignify function
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-05-16 Sat 23:43]
  Should return an string representation of the document!
* DONE Read in linewise from stdin
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-05-16 Sat 22:54]
  A test file contains a limited version of reading input from stdin
  until a delimiter occurs. Start with that simple version.

* DONE STARED print document to stream
  - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2020-05-16 Sat 22:35]
  - State "STARTED"    from              [2020-05-16 Sat 22:15]
  - State "STARED"     from "TODO"       [2020-05-16 Sat 22:08] \\
